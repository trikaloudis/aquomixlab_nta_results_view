# aquomixlab_nta_results_view
A streamlit app to briefly share non-targeted analysis results with collaborators in various projects. Especially for collaborators who are not experienced with MS data analysis. The app created boxplots of features across samples with the option to select classes or plot against metadata attributes.
Use the 2 files sent to you (a data file and a metadata file). Explore the results by selecting the samples, filtering by compound classes or grouping by sample attributes. Plots can be downloaded as png or svg.
